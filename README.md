**The minimal, self-updating Go CLI starter kit.**

Sprout provides a unified architecture for building production-ready command-line tools and system services. It eliminates the boilerplate of setting up robust CLI applications, offering a solid foundation that scales from simple scripts to complex daemons.

## Features

- **Self-Updating**: Integrated daily version checks and single-command updates.
- **Daemon Mode**: Optional systemd-managed background service capability.

- **CI/CD Ready**: Automated, changelog-driven release pipeline via Forgejo Actions.
- **Cross-Platform**: Easy installation and support for Linux and Windows (WSL).

## Architecture

Sprout is designed around the principle of unified dependency injection, ensuring that your application state is consistent and easily testable. For a deep dive into the system design, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
