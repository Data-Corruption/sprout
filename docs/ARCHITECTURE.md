# Architecture

## Problem Statement

Sprout was designed to solve several specific challenges encountered when building robust, production-ready command-line tools and system services:

1.  **Atomic Shared State**: The need for multiple CLI instances to safely interact with a single, persistent Daemon process without race conditions or data corruption.
2.  **Cross-Process/Language IPC**: Providing a high-performance, safe mechanism for Inter-Process Communication (IPC) that is accessible from various languages, not just Go.
3.  **Self-Updating Complexity**: Abstracting the complex logic required for a binary to update itself safely, especially when running as a background service or under different user permissions.
4.  **Boilerplate Fatigue**: Eliminating the repetitive setup of standard CLI features like configuration management, logging, and graceful shutdowns.

## High-Level Architecture

Sprout follows a clean, layered architecture designed for separation of concerns and testability. The core of the application is the **App** struct, which acts as a dependency injection container, managing the lifecycle of the Database, Logger, and other platform services.

### Core Components

#### 1. The Application Container (`App`)
Located in `internal/app/app.go`, the `App` struct is the heart of Sprout. It initializes and holds references to:
-   **Configuration**: Loaded from the database.
-   **Logger**: `xlog` instance for structured logging.
-   **Database**: The LMDB wrapper instance.
-   **Network**: Base URL and server configurations.
-   **Paths**: Runtime and storage directory paths.

It also manages the application lifecycle, including a cleanup stack to ensure resources (like database handles and file locks) are released correctly upon shutdown. It also provides update functionality.

#### 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Built on `urfave/cli/v3`, the CLI layer (`cmd/sprout` and `internal/app/commands`) handles user interaction. Commands are registered dynamically and injected with the `App` container, giving them access to all necessary services.

#### 3. The Daemon
Sprout can run as a background service (Daemon). This feature is toggled via template variables defined in the `./scripts/*` files. The daemon leverages `systemd` for process management and `sd_notify` for status reporting (Ready, Stopping, etc.). The service is simply an http server started via subcommand by systemd. For testing you can stop the service and run it manually in the foreground with `sprout service run`. You can also temporarily override the port in the config with `--port <port>`.

#### 4. The Database (LMDB)
Sprout uses **LMDB (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database)** for state management.
-   **Why LMDB?**
    -   **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity even if the application crashes.
    -   **Multi-Process Concurrency**: Allows multiple CLI processes and the Daemon to read/write simultaneously without corruption.
    -   **Performance**: Extremely fast reads, making it suitable for high-frequency config checks.
    -   **IPC**: Acts as a shared memory segment, effectively serving as a language-agnostic IPC mechanism.

The database logic is encapsulated in `internal/platform/database`, providing a clean API for configuration and other data buckets (DBIs).

## Data Flow

### Configuration & State
1.  **Initialization**: When Sprout starts (CLI or Daemon), it initializes the `App` struct.
2.  **DB Connection**: It opens the LMDB environment located in `~/.sprout/db`. Migrates if needed.
3.  **Config Load**: It reads the configuration from the `config` DBI.
4.  **Execution**: The command or service logic executes, reading/writing to the DB as needed.
5.  **Shutdown**: The `App.Close()` method triggers the cleanup stack, closing the DB environment.

> [!NOTE]
> `App.Close()` is deferred in the `main` function. By default, the app closes after the command or service logic completes. If running as a daemon, it continues running until the blocking call (default: HTTP server) returns. Graceful shutdown can be triggered via `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C), `SIGTERM`, or programmatically via `app.Net.Server.Shutdown(nil)`.

### Self-Update Mechanism
The update flow is sophisticated, handling different scenarios:
1.  **Check**: Queries the Release Source (e.g., R2 Bucket) for a new version. Automatic checks are lazily rate-limited to once every 24 hours. Manual checks via `YOUR_APP update --check` are not rate-limited.
2.  **Update**: Re-fetches the install script and executes it.
    -   **Deferred**: Runs after cleanup before exiting.
    -   **Detached**: Spawns a detached process to handle the update. This will result in the calling process eventually being closed by the install/update script. Also this works even if under systemd.

**PID Tracking & Safety**:
Each Sprout instance writes its PID to a runtime directory. The installer uses this to ensure all instances are shut down before updating, guaranteeing safe migrations.

> [!TIP]
> **Advanced Integration**
> If you have external non-Sprout processes accessing the database, you must replicate the migration guard logic found in `mguard.go`. Additionally, you'll need to modify the install script to account for these external processes during the shutdown phase of an update. As is, it's very conservative/safe and will only shut down Sprout processes, when looping over all the PIDs in the runtime directory.

## Directory Structure

-   `cmd/`: Main entry points (e.g., `cmd/sprout/main.go`).
-   `internal/`: Private application and platform code.
    -   `app/`: Business logic, commands, and the `App` container.
    -   `platform/`: Low-level infrastructure (Database, HTTP, Git, System).
-   `pkg/`: Publicly reusable libraries (e.g., `migrator`, `x` utilities).
-   `scripts/`: Build, install, and maintenance scripts.

## Security

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Beyond the basics (checksum verification, etc.), Sprout doesn't have a full security model. It's a starter kit / template. Different applications have totally different security requirements and threat models, so you're gonna need to design and implement your own security model. TLDR; I can't really write a one-size-fits-all security model, go read the [OWASP cheatsheet series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/) if your app will be handling sensitive data.
